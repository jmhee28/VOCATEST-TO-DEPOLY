## <div id = "overview">Voca Test Generator</div>

When learning some foreign languages such as English, Japanese, and Chinese, memorizing the words is fundamentally required. Learners often check whether they have memorized completely through tests.

However, it is unnecessary for learners to spend time generating test papers one by one. Also, even if the test paper is made, testing with the same paper every time can be a meaningless test.

Therefore, we intend to provide a foreign language word memorization test paper that can be used by anyone through this application.

### Dataset

In `dataset/` directory, there are some static foreign language words with korean meaning.

Each dataset file should be `.csv` format, which is comma-separated values. First value is for a foreign language word, and second value is a set of korean meanings of the first value.

We support below datasets and application uses these datasets to provide a test.

- Middle School Level
  - 중학 영단어 9000
  - 중학 영문법 3800제 스타터
- High School Level
  - 구문을 알아야 독해가 된다
  - 능률 voca 어원편
  - 어위끝 고교기본
  - 어휘끝 수능
- TOEIC
  - 보카바이블 3.0
- TOEFL
  - 해커스 보카 초록이

### Parser

The `Parser` module is responsible for parsing the dataset robustly. For any foreign languages, parser should provide pairs of (word, meanings). They can be used for making a new test paper for the users.

This module use regular expressions to parse appropriate values. Because a `word` value must be single word, the parts for parsing `word` check this requirement. In constrst, `meanings` value may be a set of Korean. The parts for parsing `meanings` split them to each meaning and make a list. In here, we assume that delimitters of `meanings` is one of `,`, `|`, `;`.
